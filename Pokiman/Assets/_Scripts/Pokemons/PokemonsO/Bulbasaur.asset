  description: "is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pok\xE9mon introduced in Generation I.
    Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pok\xE9mon that has blue-green skin
    with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures
    on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small,
    pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its
    thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant
    bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals
    two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides it with energy through photosynthesis
    as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within."
